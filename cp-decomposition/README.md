This is an implemetation of the method from our paper **Speeding-up Convolutional Neural Networks Using Fine-tuned CP-Decomposition**
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6553.pdf

Requrements: caffe, matlab, tensorlab (www.tensorlab.net)

Set paths to your caffe and tensorlab installations in **paths.py** before the work. 

Example script to decompose conv1 layer in LeNet convolutional network:
**python lenet/main.py**
